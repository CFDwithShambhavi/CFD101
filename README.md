This repository is committed to provide codes built on Python platform, for elementary yet insightful Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) problems.
In the begining 1D Heat Diffusion type of problems will be attempted. Later 2D Heat Diffusion will be solved. Much later in the course of these 
tutorials an attempt to solve 1D and 2D Navier-Stokes will be made for simple geometries and under certain simplifications.
The methodology adopted for the discretization of the PDEs is Finite Volume.
Quite often some relevant literature for explanation of codes and concept related to Fluid Dynamics and Heat Transfer will also be uploaded.
