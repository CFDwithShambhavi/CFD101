This repository is committed to provide codes built on Python platform, on the implementaion of Finite Volume method based discretization of 1D and 2D elementary yet insightful Convection-Diffusion problems.
In the begining 1D and 2D Heat Diffusion type of problems, for both steady and unsteady cases will be attempted.
later an attempt to solve 1D and 2D Navier-Stokes will be made for simple geometries and under certain simplifications.
Quite often some relevant literature for explanation of codes and concept related to Fluid Dynamics and Heat Transfer will also be uploaded.
